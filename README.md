### Practical Cheminformatics With Open Source Software
A set of Jupyter notebooks for learning Cheminformatics.  The links below will open the tutorials on Google Colab.
This way you can run the notebooks without having to install software on your computer. Of course, you can also just
clone the repo and run these notebooks on your own computer.

#### Additional topics will be added

### A Bit of History
These notebooks began as part of a two-day workshop I did at the University of Bonn in 2019.  Since then, they have evolved, and additional notebooks have been added. Many of the notebooks started as posts on my blog, [Practical Cheminformatics](https://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/). I originally had everything running on Binder, but I found some capacity limits with larger groups and moved everything to Google Colab.  I plan to continue adding to and revising these as long as people are interested.

### Suggestions and Corrections Welcome
This is a work in progress.  As you can see above, I'm still working on a few notebooks.  It's more than possible that these tutorials contain mistakes and/or typos.  If you find something that should be corrected, please submit an issue or a PR.  In addition, I'm always looking to improve the text.  Please let me know if aspects could be explained more clearly.  I'd also like to hear more about topics you'd like to see covered.  
If you find these tutorials useful, please consider starring this repo. 

### Acknowledgements
These tutorials wouldn't be possible without the work of Greg Landrum, Brian Kelley, and the [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/) team, as well as CÃ©dric Bouysset and his work on [mols2grid](https://github.com/cbouy/mols2grid). Thanks!
